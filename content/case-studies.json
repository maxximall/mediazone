      "body": "In the entertainment industry, where authenticity drives compelling narratives, supporting neurodivergent actors is vital for unlocking diverse creativity and representation. Our team of Clinical Psychologists are well versed in supporting actors with neurodivergence (including ADHD, Autism, Dyslexia, Dyspraxia, Dyscalculia and Tourette's), as well as reviewing scripts for accurate presentation and representation, and considering the individual needs of cast and crew.\n\nChannel 4's 2025 crime drama Patience, serves as a great case example, starring autistic and ADHD actor Ella Maisy Purvis as the neurodivergent archivist Patience Evans, who aids detectives in solving cases with her unique pattern-spotting skills. Purvis's authentic portrayal, informed by her own experiences, delivers nuanced performances that challenge stereotypes and foster empathy, much like how Robin Williams channelled his ADHD into iconic roles or Bella Ramsey infused vulnerability into The Last of Us.\n\nBy casting neurodivergent talent in these roles, productions such as Patience not only enrich storytelling but also demonstrate how hyperfocus and empathy, often traits of neurodiversity, elevate improvisation and emotional depth, proving that diverse minds are essential for innovative, relatable content. Neurodiversity isn't a deficit; it's a difference in how brains process the world, encompassing ADHD, autism, dyslexia, OCD, dyspraxia, and Tourette's. For actors, this can mean hyperfocus on character details that others overlook or an innate empathy that makes emotional scenes profoundly real. As voiceover director Marnie Demchick notes, \"Neurodivergent performers bring really nuanced performances, and often bring something to a role that other people don't\".\n\nThe entertainment industry mirrors society: diverse, messy, and full of potential. By supporting neurodivergent actors, we unlock creativity that benefits everyone, from more empathetic stories to a workforce that's truly representative. Despite breakthroughs like Patience, neurodivergent actors face significant barriers, including sensory sensitivities during auditions, last-minute script changes risking burnout, and the exhaustion of social masking to appear \"neurotypical\". To build on successes like Patience, which benefited from collaborative writing with Purvis to ensure fidelity, the industry should consider practical supports, such as risk reviewing a script, identifying strengths and potential challenging traits that may require additional support, time to allow for processing and integration, sensory breaks, clear communication, advocates for neurodiversity, and flexible schedules. As advocates and allies, we can amplify these voices through inclusive casting and resources like Equity's autistic artist networks, and creating inclusive scripts to attract neurodivergent talent, and where neurodivergence can thrive.",

      "body": "Caroline Flack: Search for the truth (streaming on Disney Plus 10th November 2025) highlights the devastating consequences of sensationalism, intrusion, and online harassment endured by those in the public eye, as well as the psychological and familial wreckage left behind.\n\nThe documentary highlights more than ever, that responsible and ethical reporting, across news media, TV production, and social media, is not just about journalistic standards; it is about protecting real lives from irreversible harm. When I am tasked with delivering mental health awareness training to production teams, I very much cite the often mis-attributed Hippocratic oath, “Primum non nocere\", first, do no harm, to promote the importance of ethical production and storytelling, and minimising risk to those we expose on screen.\n\nCaroline Flack’s final months were marked by intense media scrutiny and social media vitriol following her arrest, which compounded her existing emotional vulnerabilities and led to an overwhelming sense of isolation and despair. Her family recounts how destructive public shaming, relentless press coverage, and legal pressures worked together to rob her of hope, deeply affecting not only Caroline but also her closest relatives and friends. Panic attacks, self-harm, and a preoccupation with negative commentary were recurrent in her communications—reflections of a person who needed protection and kindness from the media and public, but instead received both suspicion and cruelty. Caroline Flack: Search for the Truth exposes not only the misrepresentation and systemic failures within policing and justice, but also the darker side of public discourse and social media commentary — a climate where personal suffering becomes fodder for clicks and outrage rather than compassion and understanding. Caroline’s mother, Christine, conducts her own investigation, assembling evidence of institutional and societal shortcomings, and advocating for change and justice—an effort motivated by grief but also by a desire to restore dignity to her daughter’s memory. Her story calls for greater accountability among journalists, producers, and social media companies. Sensational headlines, intrusive reporting, and the viral spread of negativity on digital platforms have real psychological effects. When unchecked, they can intensify distress and directly contribute to tragedies like Caroline Flack’s. Ultimately, the coverage and reflection on Caroline Flack’s story underscore the need for a cultural shift, to value kindness over sensationalism, and empathy over judgement. “Be kind” is more than a plea; it’s a moral imperative in an age where words and stories travel instantly, and the impact on individuals and families can be profound and permanent. Following the lessons of Caroline Flack’s life and legacy, media professionals, producers, content creators, and the public alike must remember that behind each story is a human being whose wellbeing should be considered against public curiosity or commercial gain.\n\nLet “Be kind” be the guiding principle for anyone with the power to influence, discuss, or disseminate stories—because genuine compassion can save lives, while carelessness can destroy them.\n\nWell done to the team at Curious Films, Dov Freedman, Sophie Clayton-Payne, and the powerful voices of Chris and the Flack Family, Mollie Grosberg , Louisa McDonald, and Paul Morris. Proud to have supported this timely documentary, and hope that this further adds to Caroline’s legacy.",
