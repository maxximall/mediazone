I've worked with Howie for over a decade, and he's my number one choice for psychological support on a show.Aside from being incredibly knowledgeable, he's also a joy to have on location. When he's not physically with the crew, it's reassuring to know he's only ever a phone call away. The man never sleeps! The world is a better place with people like Howie in it.",

The wider team means that you have plenty of options for availability and choice of matching your contributor to the psychologist you feel is most suited. Reports come back quickly, invoicing is efficient, and the trust and support offered is second to none",
